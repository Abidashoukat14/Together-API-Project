# Together-API-Project
## Python AI Chatbot and Image Generator

## Overview

Welcome to the **AI Chatbot and Image Generator** project! This Python-based application leverages the Together API model to provide two key functionalities:

1. **Interactive Chatbot**: Engage in real-time conversations with an AI chatbot designed to respond to user queries and provide helpful interactions.
2. **Image Generator**: Create and generate images based on user input. The images are stored in a dedicated folder for easy access and future use.

This project is an exciting exploration of AI capabilities, integrating natural language processing and image generation into a cohesive application.

## Features

### 1. Chatbot

- **Real-time Interaction**: Engage in conversations with the AI that can understand and respond to various queries.
- **Contextual Responses**: The chatbot provides contextually relevant answers to enhance user interaction and experience.

### 2. Image Generator

- **Custom Image Creation**: Generate images based on specific input parameters. This allows for dynamic image generation tailored to user needs.
- **Storage and Management**: Generated images are saved in a separate directory, making them easily accessible and manageable for later use.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites


- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Access to the Together API with valid API keys.

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abidashoukat/Together-Api-Project
   cd ai-chatbot-image-generator


2.**Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python libraries using the provided `requirements.txt file`:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

 3. **Configure API Keys**

Obtain your API keys from Together API and configure them in the `config.py` file or set them as environment variables. This step is crucial for authenticating your API requests.

 4. **Run the Application**

Execute the main script to start both the chatbot and image generator functionalities:

  `python main.py`

5. **Explore Generated Images**

Images created by the generator will be stored in the `generated_images directory`. You can view, organize, and save these images as needed.

6. **Project Structure**
`main.py`: Entry point for the application that initializes and runs both the chatbot and image generator.
`chatbot.py`: Contains the logic and functions for handling chatbot interactions.
`image_generator.py`: Manages the image generation process, including API interactions and file storage.
`config.py`: Configuration file for storing API keys and other settings.
`generated_images/`: Directory where generated images are saved.
`requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.

8. **Usage**
After starting the application, you can interact with the chatbot through the terminal or any connected interface. For image generation, provide the desired parameters, and the system will create and store the image in the `generated_images` directory.
